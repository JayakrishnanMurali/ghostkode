I tried to login to github last week from my laptop and was surprised by a new authentication prompt. I followed all the
steps and was able to login without any passwords or 2FA's. I did some research and found out that github
had implemented passkeys. I was intrigued and decided to learn more about them.

### Lets talk about the `Why` first

One of the major problems I faced with passwords is that they are harder to remember. I have to use a password manager to
store all my passwords. I have to remember the master password for the password manager. I have to use 2FA's for
authentication. If we are not using a password manager, we probably use one easy to remember password for all our accounts.

> We can see the problem here. Passwords are harder to remember and easy to crack. They can also be a pain to
> remember hundreds of them without a password manager.

### What are passkeys?

Enters passkeys. Passkeys let us login to our accounts without using passwords and verify anyone's identity by using
biometric information, providing a more secure and easier ways to access apps and websites. If we are
using a website that supports passkeys, we don't have to worry about any 2FA's or OTP. This also reduces the risk of
account breaching.

Passkeys are [FIDO2-complaint](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/) technology that offers a safer login alternative in a world of advanced
cyber threats.

### How do passkeys work?

Passkeys make use of an API called [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.io/) or Web Authentication. The API was developed by
[FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/), an open industry association with a focused mission: authentication
standards to help reduce the world's over-reliance on passwords and [WorldWideWeb Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/),
a community that works together to develop Web standards.

The main component behind passkey is a cryptographic key pair. The key pair consists of a public key and a private key.
The private key is stored on our device and the public key is stored on the server. When create one account the
corresponding public key is uploaded to a server. When we try to login to the account, the server sends a unique
challenge to our device. The device then signs the challenge with the private key and sends it back to the server. Our
device only does so if we approve this, either by using a biometric or a PIN. The server then verifies the signature with
our public key.

> The private key is never shared with the server. The server only stores the public key.
> Each passkey can only be used for a single account, there is no risk of reusing them across services.

The private key behind the passkey lives on our devices and in some cases, it stays only on the device it was created on.
In other cases, our operating system or an app similar to a password manager may sync it to other devices we own.

We can use passkey from our phone to sign in to other device by scanning a QR displayed on that device. After proper
verification the phone then sends a one time passkey signature, which requires biometric authentication on phone.
Neither the passkey itself nor the screen lock information is sent to the new device.

### Future looks bright and secure

Passkeys are a promising step forward for password-less authentication. They make it simple to use our
existing devices to sign in, rather than a security key. The future for passkey protocols looks great
as we will see more and more applications getting first class support. We're still in the early days of all this,
but expect to see it mentioned more and more.
